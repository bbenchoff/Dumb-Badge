The following is a list of Escape and Command codes supported by the VT-69. This
list is taken (or influenced) by VT100 Series Video Terminal Technical Manual 
(EK-VT100-TM-003) appendix A and D, ANSI Code Extension (ANSI Standard 
X3.64-1974, X3.64-1979 (ISO 2022 and 6429)), "A parser for DECâ€™s ANSI-
compatible video terminals" by Paul Flow Williams (vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser)
and "Towards Standardized Video Terminals: ANSI X3.64 Device Control" Mark L. 
Siegel, BYTE Magazine April 1984, pp365-374.

Note VT-52 modes _are not supported_, as the VT-69 is an ANSI terminal.

Definitions -- The following listing defines the basic elements of the ANSI 
escape sequences.

Control Sequence Introducer (CSI) -- An escape sequence that provides 
supplementary controls and is itself a prefix affecting the interpretation of a
limited number of contiguous characters. The CSI for the VT-69 is ESC [
(0x1B, 0x5B).

Parameter -- A string of one or more decimal character that represent a single
value.

Numeric Parameter -- A string of characters that represent a number, designated
by Pn. Pn has a range of 0 to 9.

Mnemonic -- Code as described in ANSI X3.64-1979 and DEC VT100 Series Video
Terminal Technical Manual. These mnemonics will are used as internal codes or
functions for the VT-69 where applicable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CBT - Cursor Backwards Tab
	Moves the cursor horizontally and backwards to the preceding tabulation
	stop. A parameter of zero or one will indicate the preceding horizontal
	tabulation stop. A larger value (N) will indicate the Nth preceding
	horizontal tabulation stop is desired.

CHA	- Cursor Horizontal Absolute
	Moves the curor forward or backward along the active line to the character
	position specified by the parameter. A parameter value of zero or one
	moves the character position to the first character position of the active
	line. A parameter value of N moves the active position to character
	position N of the active line.

CHT - Cursor Horizontal Tab
	Advance the active position horizontally to the next tabulation stop
	according to the parameter value. A parameter value of zero or one will
	indicate the next horizontal tabulation stope, and a larger value (N) will
	indicate the Nth following horizontal tabulation stop is desired.

CNL - Cursor New Line
	Moves the cursor to the first position of the next display line or Nth
	following display line depending on the parameter. A parameter value of
	zero or one indicates the next line. A parameter value of N indicates the
	Nth following line.

CPL - Cursor Preceding Line
	Moves the active position to the first position of the preceding display
	line or Nth preceding display line, depending on the parameter. A parameter
	value of zero or one indicates the preceding line. A parameter value of N
	indicates the Nth preceding line.

CTC	- Cursor Tabulation Control
	Causes one or more tabulation stops to be set or cleared according to the
	parameters. All lines are effected (as we are not dealing with Tabulation
	Stop Mode):

	0 or none	Set a horizontal tabulation stop at the active position
	2			Clear horizontal tabulation at the active position
	5			Clear all horizontal tabulation stops in the device

	All other parameters are ignored.

CUB	- Cursor Backward
	Moves the cursor in the backward direction. The distance moved is determined
	by the parameter. If the parameter value is zero or one, the cursor is moved
	one position. If the parameter value is N, the cursor is moved N positions.

CUD - Cursor Down
	Moves the cursor in the down direction. The distance moved is determined by
	the parameter. If the parameter value is zero or one, the cursor is moved
	one position. If the parameter value is N, the cursor is moved N positions.

CUF - Cursor Forward
	Moves the cursor in the forward direction. The distance moved is determined
	by the parameter. If the parameter value is zero or one, the cursor is moved
	one position. If the parameter value is N, the cursor is moved N positions.

CUP	- Cursor Postition
	Moves the active position to the position specified by the parameters. This
	sequence has two parameter values, the first specifing the vertical position
	and the second specifying the horizontal position. A parameter value of zero
	or one for the first or second parameter moves the active position of the
	first line or column in the display respectively. The default condition with
	no parameters present is equivalent to a Cursor to Home action.

CUU	- Cursor Up
	Moves the cursor in the up direction. The distance moved is determined by
	the parameter. If the parameter value is zero or one, the cursor is moved
	one position. If the parameter value is N, the cursor is moved N positions.

DCH - Delete Character
	Deletes the character at the cursor and possibly other adjacent characters
	according to the parameter. The adjacent string of characters, if any, is
	shifted towards the active position. The vacated character positions at the
	other end are erased. A parameter value of zero or one indicates one
	character is removed. A parameter value of N indicates that N characters are
	removed.

	The extent (display, line) of the string affected is determined by the
	setting of the Editing Extent Mode (see SEM).

ECH	- Erase Character
	Erases the character at the cursor and possibly other following characters,
	according to the parameter. The position of the cursor is unchanged. A
	numeric parameter of zero or one indicates that one character is erased. A
	numeric parameter of N indicates that N characters are erased.

EL	- Erase In Line
	Erases line, depending on parameter:

	0 or none	Erase from cursor to end of line
	1			Erase from beginning of line to cursor
	2			Erase entire line containing cursor

	Any other parameters are ignored.

ED	- Erase In Display
	Erases display, depending on parameter:

	0 or none	Erase from cursor to end of screen
	1			Erase from beginning of screen to cursor
	2			Erase entire screen

	Any other parameters are ignored.

HTS - Horizontal Tab Set
	Sets one horizontal tabulation stop at the cursor.

IND - Index
	Causes the cursor to move downward one line without changing the horizontal
	position.

NEL	- Next Line
	Causes the cursor to move to the first position on the next line downward.

RC - Restore Cursor Position
	Restores the cursor to the position saved with SC. If no cursor position has
	been saved, the default is the first character position of the first line.

RI - Reverse Index
	Moves the cursor to the same horizontal position on the preceding line.

RIS - Reset to Initial State
	Resets a device to its initial state, that is, the state it has after it is
	switched on. This affects resetting of all tabulation, reset graphic
	rendition, erasure of all positions, and moving the cursor to the first
	character position of the first line.

SC - Save Cursor Position
	Saves cursor position.

SEM	- Select Edit Extent Mode
	Selects the extent of the display to be affected by the Insert Character 
	(ICH) and Delete Character (DCH) actions according to th parameter:

	0 or none	Edit in Display
	1			Edit in Line

	Any other parameters are ignored.

SGR - Select Graphic Rendition
	PS refers to a selective parameter. Multiple parameters may be seperated by
	the semicolon character (Esc [ Ps;Ps;Ps m) The parameters are executed in
	order and have the following meanings:

	0 or none	All attributes off
	1			Bold on
	4			Underscore on
	5			Blink on
	7			Reverse video on

	Any other parameters are ignored.
